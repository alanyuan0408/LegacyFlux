            </h3>
            <p>
                Here's a message from Sven:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                Dear undergrad students,
                <p>
                    Last year, DCS engaged in an external review process, which began with the preparation of a self-study that included a town hall forum in which we solicited from our undergraduate student body their concerns about the department, their programs, their labs &#8212; anything at all that they wanted to share with us. Last Spring, an external review team visited the department, and met with a handful of undergraduate students to hear their perspectives on DCS. That process culminated in an external review document that addresses all aspects of the department, including undergraduate education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last step in the process involves the Department preparing an "administrative response" to this review, where we respond to particular issues raised by the reviewers. In preparation for that response, we've scheduled a town hall meeting, in which we'd like to share with you the undergraduate education-related issues, let you know about the progress we've made on these issues, and hear your feedback and suggestions on how we can improve your undergraduate experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The town hall meeting for our undergrad students will be scheduled for:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thursday, January 22, 2015, 11 AM - 1 PM, location BA 1170
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope to see you there!
                </p>
                <p>

                IBM Watson: Team ROSS takes second place!
            </h3>
            <p>
                Team <a href="http://www.poweredbyross.com">ROSS</a> has returned from the IBM Watson Cognitive Computing Competition, bringing home an incredible result: a second place finish.
            </p>
            <p>
                The invitation-only IBM Watson Cognitive Computing Competition pit UofT against 9 top-notch universities, including Carnegie Mellon University, the University of California at Berkeley, and the University of Texas at Austin in a semester-long competition to develop a business plan and a prototype of an application built around IBM Watson. We're proud to say that we are the only computer science department outside of the US to be invited to participate.
            </p>
            <p>
                ROSS developed their business plan in CSC454 Business of Software, taught by Mario Grech and Helen Kontozopoulos, and developed their Watson-based applcation in a special edition of CSC490, a capstone design project course, taught by Steve Engels.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final contest, held on January 9, brought team members Andrew Arruda, Pargles Dall'oglio, Jimoh Ovbiagele, Akash Venkat and Shuai Wang to New York City, where they pitched their legal app ROSS &#8212; an artificially intelligent attorney &#8212; to IBM's panel of technical and business executives. They placed a very close second to UT Austin, who built their plan around a non-profit call centre app. IBM has posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZDyxLlNKRY-2oGTHZrKILIDz7u4-p3dR">the demo videos of all the entries</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                ROSS has huge momentum. They're moving out of the academic environment and into the IBM entrepreneurial ecosystem, and they're on a trajectory to change the landscape of legal research.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you see any of the team members (or the instructors, for that matter), please congratulate them!
            </p>

            <p>
                This is an opportunity to get your feet wet with writing code for game AIs, become familiar with PyGame, and have your AI beat your friends' AIs at Pong!
            </p>
            <p>
                You can participate individually or in a team of two.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prizes: (really cool-looking) Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals for each member of the teams that win first, second, and third places. Diplomas for teams that earn an Honourable Mention. (Get bragging rights for your resume!)
            </p>
            <p>
                The deadline to enter is March 10, 2015.

                Peer Coaching tool for interviews
            </h3>
            <p>
                Some 4th year UofT students have developed <a href="http://intervu.wix.com/intervu">INTERVU</a>, a tool to manage a network of peer coaches with industry expertise to help students prepare for upcoming interviews.
            </p>
            <p>
                They are looking to expand their team of coaches (both students and alumni) who are looking to pay it forward and offer interview coaching to their peers. So far there is an engineering and business focus, but they are currently recruiting peer coaches from Computer Science.

                Tidbits about the University: University Governance
            </h3>
            <p>
                The <a href="http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/Governing_Council/bac/gc.htm">Governing Council</a> manages all academic and business affairs of the UofT. There are three boards that report to the Governing Council: the Academic Board, which is responsible for teaching, learning, and research; the Business Board, which manages resource allocations and approves business-related university policy; and the University Affairs Board, which deals with non-academic policy around areas such as quality of student life.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <a href="http://www.president.utoronto.ca">President of the UofT is Meric Gertler</a>. The president is much like the CEO of a corporation. His responsibilities are the "general supervision over and direction of the academic work of the University and the teaching and administrative staffs thereof." Meric gives <a href="http://www.president.utoronto.ca/speeches">a lot of speeches</a>. (Really good ones!)
            </p>
            <p>
                Working alongside the President is the <a href="http://www.provost.utoronto.ca">Vice President and Provost, Cheryl Regehr</a>. Cheryl manages the academic and budgetary matters at the University of Toronto. There are <a href="http://www.president.utoronto.ca/duties-responsibilities-2">several other VPs</a> who work directly with Meric.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <a href="http://www.chancellor.utoronto.ca">Chancellor, The Honourable Michael H. Wilson</a>, is the titular head of the UofT, and he is an ambassador to the outside world. You'll probably see Michael at graduation: the Chancellor confers all degrees of the UofT.
